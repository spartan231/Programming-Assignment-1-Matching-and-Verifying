Source Code:
- Matching Engine - src/matchingEngine.py
- Verifier - src/verifier.py
- Input - data/sampleData.txt
- Output -

Assumptions:

Graph/Solution:  
The graph shows that as the number of hospitals and students increase, the matching engine and the verifier grows quadratically. When input size doubles, the running time increases by about four times.
